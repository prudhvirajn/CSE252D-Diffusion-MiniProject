# CSE252D-Diffusion-MiniProject

This is the mini-project for CSE 252D Advanced Computer Vision (Spring 2023). We implement a pipeline to generate story-boards from a start prompt and end prompt.

## Generating Action Prompts using ChatGPT

Pass in the Input:
```
Example: 
1. "Man walks towards car"
2. "Man opens the car door"
3. "Man sits in the car"
4. "Car drives away"

Write me another sequence of actions like above that starts with "{start_prompt}" and ends with "{end_prompt}"
```

## Structure of dataset.json
The file "dataset.json" stores information passed into the stable diffusion model to generate images. It contains following fields:

* negative_prompt: a universal list of keywords telling the model what not to generate. This filters out most low quality and unwanted images.
* scripts: a list of sequences of prompts telling the model what to generate for each key frame. Each sequence is generated by ChatGPT as mentioned above.
* prefixes & suffixes: descriptive keywords used to control the texture, style and coloring of images.

## Installing

To install dependencies, simply run

`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
